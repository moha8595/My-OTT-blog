                <h1>My OTT blog</h1>
                <p>OTT (over-the-top) is a means of providing television and 
                film content over the internet at the request and to suit the requirements of the individual consumer.
                The term itself stands for “over-the-top”, which implies that a content provider is going over 
                the top of existing internet services.</p>

                    <h3>About these OTT's</h3>
                    <p> OTT television, usually called online television or internet television or streaming television, remains the most popular OTT content. This signal is received over the Internet or through a cell phone network, as opposed to receiving the television signal from a terrestrial broadcast or satellite. Access is controlled by the video distributor, through either an app or a separate OTT dongle or box, connected to a phone, PC or smart television set. By mid-2017, 58 per cent of US households would access one in a given month and advertising revenues from OTT channels exceeded those from web browser plug-ins.</p>

                    <h3>Need of OTT's</h3>
                    <p>Over-the-top (OTT) is a media service in which companies offer product streaming online directly as an individual commodity. Publications have rightly dubbed this media service as the future of television because of its constant surge in popularity.

                        The technique ditches conventional broadcasting methods and instead uses the internet to relay content. For this reason, many consumers with an internet connection, a wi-fi capable device like a smart TV or a streaming stick can easily access this service.</p>
